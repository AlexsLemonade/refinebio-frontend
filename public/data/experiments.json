            "description": "Tumor tissue heterogeneity is a well known feature of several solid tumors. Neuroblastic Tumors (NTs) is a group of paediatric cancers with a great tissue heterogeneity. Most of NTs are composed of undifferentiated, poorly differentiated or differentiating neuroblastic (Nb) cells with very few or absent Schwannian stromal (SS) cells: these tumors are grouped as Neuroblastoma (Schwannian stroma-poor). The remaining NTs are composed of abundant SS cells and classified as Ganglioneuroblastoma (Schwannian stroma-rich) intermixed or nodular and Ganglioneuroma. The importance to understand Nb and SS gene signatures in NTs, is to clarify the complex network mechanism of tumor growth and progression. In order to identify the Nb and SS cells gene signatures, we analyzed the gene expression profiling of 19 cases of neuroblastic tumors: 10 stroma poor (NTs-SP) and 9 stroma rich (NTs-SR), by high density oligonucleotide microarrays. Moreover, the analysis was performed in parallel on both whole and laser microdissected tumor samples: from 4 of 19 cases, was isolated different areas all composed of pure cellular populations. We performed genome wide expression analysis by using Affymetrix technology and we used two different approaches for data analysis: SAM (Significance Analysis of Microarrays) and a method based on Game Theory (GT), to identify genes differently expressed in SS and Nb cells. Differently from the SAM method, the analysis based on GT (Moretti et al. (2006)) gives the advantage of selecting relevant genes not only according to the expression profile of each single gene, but considering also gene interaction. Experiment Overall Design: Tissue samples from 10 primary neuroblastoma stroma-poor (NTs-SP) and 9 ganglioneuroblastoma/ganglioneuroma stroma-rich (NTs-SR) tumors, were obtained at diagnosis from patients at different clinical stage. Frozen samples of NTs-SP had a minimum content of 90% of malignant cells, while NTs-SR had more than 80-90% of schwannian stromal cells. Four out of 19 NTs: 2 neuroblastomas (Schwannian stoma-poor) and 2 ganglioneublastomas (Schwannian stroma-rich), were further analyzed with laser microdissection.",

            "description": "The polyarticular and oligoarticular forms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis are classified as distinct entities. At the same time, many children who present with an oligoarticular phenotype eventually evolve to a polyarticular disease pattern, suggesting that the phenotypes might share with overlapping molecular mechanisms. Using gene expression microarrays, we found that 14 genes in neutrophils and 55 genes in PBMC shows common patterns of differential expression when children with active oligoarticular and polyarticular JIA were compared with healthy controls. These results demonstrate that there are commonalities between oligoarticular and polyarticular JIA that suggest overlapping immune mechanisms. Total RNA was extracted from isolated PBMC and neutrophils from 14 patients with polyarticular JIA and 8 patients with pauciarticular JIA. Total RNA was extracted from neutrophils from 13 healthy controls and from PBMC from 15 healthy controls. Insufficient RNA for microarrays was obtained from neutrophils from two of the healthy controls.",

            "description": "Gene expression analysis was performed on 30 Neuroblastomas to identify genes whose transcription is significantly altered by recurrent chromosomal alterations. Genomic copy number losses and gains had been delineated in the tumours using FISH and SNP arrays. We have identified genes significantly altered by 7 recurrent alterations: 1p, 3p, 4p, 10q and 11q loss, 2p and 17q gain, and genes co-amplified and over-expressed as a result of MYCN amplification. Identifying genes whose expression is consistently altered by chromosomal gains or losses is an important step in defining genes of biological relevance in a wide variety of tumour types. However, additional criteria are needed to discriminate further among the large number of candidate genes identified. This is particularly true for neuroblastoma, where multiple genomic copy number changes of proven prognostic value exist. We have used Affymetrix microarrays and a combination of fluorescent in-situ hybridisation and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarrays to establish expression profiles and delineate copy number alterations in 30 primary neuroblastomas. Experiment Overall Design: 30 neuroblastomas were obtained from patients of all stages (10 patients - stage 1, 2, 3 or 4s disease, 20 patients - stage 4 disease). RNA samples were extracted and analysed using Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Arrays.

We quantified mRNA expression in a highly annotated series of 101 prospectively collected diagnostic neuroblastoma primary tumors  and the expression profiles were determined using Affymetrix U95Av2 arrays.  Comparisons between the sample groups allow the identification of genes with localized expression patterns. This study demonstrates that the genomic data can be used to subcategorize the disease into molecular subsets and the regional copy number alterations are correlated with a broad number of transcriptional alterations genome wide. This data also suggests that multiple genes from several discrete regions of the human genome co-operate to supress neuroblastoma tumorigenesis and progression.

Those diagnosed before one year of age are least aggressive and those diagnosed after two years are most aggressive. To improve current risk stratification and gain insight into the biological processes that account for this phenomenon, we analyzed expression profiles from 102 primary untreated neuroblastomas. A 55 gene model classified patients diagnosed after 12 months of age based on molecular risk with an error rate of 17.5%. The progression-free survival for this group was 16% and 79% if their tumors had molecular high or low risk profiles (p<0.001). Expression profiles of tumors with molecular high-risk features included genes relating to regulation of growth and programmed cell death. This series also includes 15 samples obtained at disease relapse.  Fourteen out of the fifteen samples had molecular high risk features. Experiment Overall Design: 102 samples obtained at diagnosis were analyzed for model generation and compared to 15 obtained at relapse, using Affymetrix HG-U133A (GPL96) and HG-U133B (GPL97) platforms.",

            "description": "Sarcoidosis, a systemic granulomatous syndrome invariably affecting the lung, typically spontaneously remits but in ~20% of cases progresses with severe lung dysfunction or cardiac and neurologic involvement (complicated sarcoidosis). Unfortunately, current biomarkers fail to distinguish patients with remitting (uncomplicated) sarcoidosis from other fibrotic lung disorders, and fail to identify individuals at risk for complicated sarcoidosis. We utilized genome-wide peripheral blood gene expression analysis to identify a gene signature distinguishing sarcoidosis from healthy controls, which also served as a molecular signature for complicated sarcoidosis. Total RNA was isolated from PBMCs using standard molecular biology protocols without DNA contamination or RNA degradation. Sample processing (e.g., cDNA generation, fragmentation, end labeling, hybridization to Affymetrix GeneChip Human Exon 1.0 ST arrays) was performed per manufacturer’s instructions. A total of 29 African descent American (AA) and 10 European descent American (EA) patients with sarcoidosis were included in the overall sarcoidosis cohort with 18 AA and 4 EA patients diagnosed with complicated sarcoidosis.",

It is especially challenging to identify main-regulatory routes, and to generalize conclusions obtained from experimental models. We designed the bioinformatic platform R2 in parallel with a wet-lab approach of neuroblastoma. Here we demonstrate how R2 facilitates an integrated analysis of our neuroblastoma data. Analysis of the MYCN pathway suggested important regulatory connections to the polyamine synthesis route, the Notch pathway and the BMP/TGFβ pathway. A network of genes emerged connecting major oncogenes in neuroblastoma. Genes in the network carried strong prognostic values and were essential for tumor cell survival. 88 human Neuroblastoma samples were analyzed.",

            "description": "We generated gene expression profiles from 498 primary neuroblastomas using RNA-Seq and microarrays. We sought to systematically evaluate the capability of RNA deep-sequencing (RNA-Seq)-based classification for clinical endpoint prediction in comparison to microarray-based ones. The neuroblastoma cohort was randomly divided into training and validation sets, and 360 predictive models on six clinical endpoints were generated and evaluated. While prediction performances did not differ considerably between the two technical platforms, the RNA-Seq data processing pipelines, or feature levels (i.e., gene, transcript, and exon junction levels), RNA-Seq models based on the AceView database performed best on most endpoints. Collectively, our study reveals an unprecedented complexity of the neuroblastoma transcriptome, and provides guidelines for the development of gene expression-based predictive classifiers using high-throughput technologies.  Sample clinical characteristics definitions:  dataset: Expression data set used for classification training (1) or validation (2) Sex: M = male; F= female age at diagnosis: the age in days at diagnosis mycn status: Amplification status of the MYCN proto-oncogene (amplified = 1, no amplification = 0; no information = N/A) high risk: Clinically considered as high-risk neuroblastoma (yes=1, no= 0) INSS stage: disease stage according to International Neuroblastoma Staging System (INSS) (1, 2, 3, 4 and 4S) class label: Maximally divergent disease courses - unfavorable (= 1): patient died despite intensive chemotherapy, favorable (=0): patient survived without chemotharapy for at least 1000 days post diagnosis; not applicable (N/A) progression: Occurrence of a tumor progression event (yes=1; no=0) death from disease: Occurrence of death from the disease (yes=1; no=0) Gene expression of 498 neuroblastoma samples was quantified by RNA sequencing as well as by microarray analyses in order to understand the neuroblastoma transcriptome and predict clinical endpoints.",

The aim of the present study was to identify and confirm gene signatures and novel biomarkers in various cohorts of untreated and treated patients diagnosed with jSpA and other forms of juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). DNA microarray gene expression was performed in 11 patients with jSpA and in four healthy controls, along with bioinformatics analysis of retrieved data (DAVID, GSEA, IPA). Total RNA was isolated from whole blood of 45 children with known HLA genotype and diagnosis of jSpA according to ILAR criteria, 11 children with oligo- and polyarticular forms of JIA, as well as 12 age and sex matched control participants without diagnosis of chronic inflammatory disease. Of those 11 patient and 4 controls were utilized in the microarrays experiments, while the rest were used in the follow-up qPCR analyses",

Using microarray analyses of 342 primary tumors, we here developed and validated an easy to use gene expression-based risk score including 18 genes, which can robustly predict the outcome of stage 4 patients. This classifier was a significant predictor of overall survival in two independent validation cohorts (cohort 1 (n=214): P=6.3x10-5; cohort 2 (n=27): P=3.1x10-2). The prognostic value of the risk score was validated by multivariate analysis including the established markers age and MYCN status (P=0.027). In the pooled validation cohorts (n=241), integration of the risk score with the age and/or MYCN status identified subgroups with significantly differing overall survival (ranging from 35% to 100%). Together, the 18-gene risk score classifier can identify patients with stage 4 NB with favorable outcome and may therefore improve risk assessment and treatment stratification of NB patients with disseminated disease. We analyzed expression profiling arrays of 27 Tumor samples from stage 4 neuroblastoma patients.",

            "description": "Neuroblastoma (NB) is the most common extra cranial solid tumor in infants. Although several risk factors including patient age, disease stage and genetic abnormalities, such as MYCN amplification and 11q deletion, have been shown to predict outcome, the mechanisms responsible for the heterogeneous clinical behavior of this tumor, ranging from spontaneous regression to rapid progression of disease and patient’s death, remain largely unknown. Patients with disseminated disease mainly show metastasis at bone marrow (BM) and bone. The presence of metastasis is an independent unfavorable prognostic factor for NB patients over 18 months of age at diagnosis, whose event-free and overall survivals are grim despite intensive multimodal therapies. We decided to investigate the transcriptome of both NB metastatic cells and resident hematopoietic BM cells to get insight on potential targets for diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic purposes. Hereby, we report on the results obtained by comparing BM resident hematopoietic cells in the presence and absence of infiltrating NB hematopoietic cells with BM cells from young healthy donors. We analyzed gene expression profiles of 40 bone marrow samples: 8 from healthy young donor; 23 from NB patients with stage 1, 2, 3; 9 from NB patients with stage 4.",

The biopsies were taken at the most affected sites but at a distance of ulcerations. Disease activity was endoscopically assessed. Total RNA extracted from mucosal biopsies was used to analyze mRNA expression via Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST arrays",
