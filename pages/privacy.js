      (this <strong>"Privacy Policy"</strong>) to explain what information we
      gather when you visit or interact with the CCDL, how we and others may use
      your information, and the security approaches we use to protect your
      information. This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and made part of the

      Policy have the meanings given to them in the Terms of Use.

    <p>
      By using the CCDL, you consent to the collection and use of your
      information in accordance with this Privacy Policy. If we decide to change

      Changes to this Privacy Policy will apply only to information collected

    <ol className="terms__list--bold">
      <li>
        What information is gathered?
        <p>
          We may collect and retain information from or about you when you
          register on the CCDL, seek authentication, send or respond to
          communications, or participate in another CCDL feature. Here are the
          types of personal information we gather:
        </p>
        <ul className="terms__list">
          <li>
            <strong>Information You Give Us:</strong> When registering or
            seeking authentication, or otherwise communicating with us, we may
            ask you for your name, email address, mailing address, phone number,
            credentials or other similar information.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Automatic Information:</strong> We receive and store certain
            types of information whenever you interact with us, including IP
            addresses and session identifiers. We may use "cookies" or other
            tracking tools to enhance your experience and gather information
            about Users and visits to the CCDL. Please refer to the "May we use
            'cookies' or other tracking tools?" section below for information
            about cookies and how we may use them.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Information from Other Sources:</strong> For purposes such
            as authentication, monitoring, completeness or accuracy, we may
            receive information about you from other sources, including third
            parties you have authorized to share information with us, and we may
            add or relate such information to your account.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        How do we respond to "Do Not Track" signals?
        <p>
          Because there is not yet a common understanding of how to interpret
          web browser-based "Do Not Track" (<strong>"DNT"</strong>) signals
          other than cookies, we do not currently respond to, or provide Users
          with a different CCDL experience based on, undefined "DNT" signals to
          the CCDL.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        How do we use your personal information?
        <p>
          We may use your personal information in any of the following ways:
        </p>
        <ul className="terms__list">

            you.

          <li>
            To provide or facilitate any services or transactions associated
            with your account.
          </li>
          <li>
            To personalize and optimize your CCDL experience and to learn about
            your preferences.
          </li>
          <li>
            To monitor your compliance with the Terms of Use and all applicable
            Policies.
          </li>
          <li>To prevent or remedy any unauthorized or disruptive activity.</li>
          <li>To administer a survey or other CCDL feature.</li>
          <li>

        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>
        Do we disclose the information we collect?
        <p>
          We generally do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer personal
          information to outside parties unless we provide you with advance
          notice. However, we may disclose personal information as described
          below:
        </p>
        <ul className="terms__list">
          <li>
            <strong>Agents and Contractors:</strong> We may contract with other
            companies and individuals to operate the CCDL and to perform
            functions on our behalf. Examples include maintaining and hosting
            the CCDL, analyzing data, and providing support. Our agents and
            contractors have access to personal information needed to perform
            their functions, but they must reasonably safeguard such information
            and they may not use it or disclose it for other purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Authentication:</strong> We may disclose your personal
            information to third parties as reasonably necessary to authenticate
            you and your information, as applicable.

            <strong>Business Transfers:</strong> In the event that we sell or
            otherwise transfer our assets, or reorganize, merge or transfer our
            entity, we may provide your information to the purchaser to enable
            continued use of the CCDL. We will take reasonable steps to seek
            similar treatment of your information, but the purchaser might
            operate under a different privacy policy.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Protection of Us and Others:</strong> We release personal
            information when we believe it is appropriate to comply with law;
            enforce or apply the Terms of Use or our other applicable Policies
            or agreements; or protect the rights, privacy, property, or safety
            of us, Users or others. We may share information regarding
            unauthorized or suspicious activity with affected Users, an
            independent Institutional Review Board or other ethics board, or
            institutional authorities, as applicable.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Subject to applicable law, we may share aggregated and statistical
          information with third parties.

        May we use "cookies" or other tracking tools?
        <p>
          Yes. We may use web tracking tools such as cookies and web beacons. A
          cookie is a small data file that certain websites write to your hard
          drive when you visit those pages, but the only personal information a
          cookie can contain is information you supply yourself. We may use
          cookies to track User traffic patterns when you click on various links
          throughout the CCDL to help us understand your preferences and to
          offer better experiences and tools on the CCDL.
        </p>
        <p>
          We may contract with third party service providers to assist us in
          better understanding our Users, including tracking User clicks and
          recording anonymized User sessions. These service providers are not
          permitted to use the information collected on our behalf, except to
          help us conduct and improve the CCDL.

        <p>
          You can choose to have your computer warn you each time a cookie is
          being sent, or you can choose to turn off all cookies, through your
          browser settings. Each browser is a little different, so look at your
          browser Help menu to learn the correct way to modify your cookies. If
          you turn cookies off, you might not be able to access or use certain
          CCDL services, features or functionality.

        How secure is personal information?
        <p>
          We follow generally accepted industry security standards to safeguard
          and help prevent unauthorized access, maintain data security, and
          properly use your personal information. However, no commercial method
          of information transfer over the Internet or electronic data storage
          is known to be 100% secure. As a result, we cannot guarantee the
          absolute security of that information during its transmission or its
          storage in our systems.
        </p>

          It is important for you to protect against unauthorized access to your
